                    <br>
                    <h5>Booking your Holiday</h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        a) Your contract in respect of your holiday is made with Elite Travel & Tourism (‘the
                        Company‘), registered in Oman and all bookings are subject to these terms and
                        conditions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        b) All communications by the Company in relation to your holiday will be sent to the
                        address stated on the booking form.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        c) All bookings must be made through an authorised representative of the Company. At the
                        time of booking the Company booking form must be completed and submitted together with a
                        deposit of 50% of the total cost of the booking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        d) Receipt of the deposit and booking form by the Company does neither guarantee nor
                        imply confirmation of the booking. No booking shall be confirmed until the Company
                        issues a written notice. The Company reserves the right to refuse a booking without
                        giving any reason and shall in that event return any deposit received.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        e) Your holiday must be paid in full at least 30 days before the departure date. If
                        payment is not received by the due date, the Company reserves the right to cancel the
                        booking and retain the deposit. The person who signs the booking form guarantees payment
                        of the total amount shown on the booking form in accordance with these conditions. It is
                        the responsibility of the signatory to ensure the Company receives payment in full by
                        the due date. No reminders will be sent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        f) If you book within 30 days of your departure date payment must be made in full at the
                        time ofbooking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        g) All special requests, such as dietary requirements, should be noted on the booking
                        form.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        h) The Company will provide the service as set out and confirmed in writing.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h5>Price Policy </h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        a) The Company is under no obligation to furnish a breakdown of the costs
                        involved in a holiday.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        b) The Company reserves the right to notify you of any increase in price before
                        accepting your booking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        c) After a Confirmation Invoice has been issued, unless you choose to pay for
                        your holiday in full at the time of booking, the price of your holiday is subject to the
                        possibilities of surcharges in certain limited circumstances. However, a surcharge will only be
                        levied to allow for variations in transportation cost, including cost of fuel, increase in
                        normal published airfares, taxes or fees chargeable for services such as landing taxes at
                        airports, the exchange
                        rate applied to the particular package or if the government or regulatory body introduce an
                        increase
                        of taxes. Even then, the Company will absorb an amount equal to 2% of your holiday price
                        (excluding insurance
                        premiums and amendment charges) before passing on any surcharge to you. Only amounts in excess
                        of this 2%
                        will be surcharged. Surcharges will be notified by a revised Confirmation Invoice sent to you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        d) If a surcharge would increase the total holiday price shown on your original
                        Confirmation Invoice by 10% or more, you may cancel your booking within 14 days of the date of
                        issue of the
                        revised Invoice and obtain a full refund of all payments made to the Company and any amendment
                        charges previously incurred.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        e) Optionally, you may choose to pay for your holiday in full at the time of
                        booking, in which case your holiday price will be fixed at the cost quoted by the Company at the
                        time. To qualify
                        for this benefit you should return the Confirmation Invoice to the Company with full payment to
                        reach the Company within 7 days of the date printed on the Confirmation Invoice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        f) The financial commitments offered above by the Company mean that the Company
                        is not able to reduce the holiday prices should the value of the Omani Rial
                        strengthen.
                    </p>
